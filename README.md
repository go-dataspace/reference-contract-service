Reference contract service

## Introduction

*Note:* This has currently only been tested with requesting resources, not with
sharing.

This is a reference contract service implementation to manage transitions in
contract states for [RUN-DSP](https://github.com/go-dataspace/run-dsp/), using
the GRPC bindings located at
[RUN-DSRPC](https://github.com/go-dataspace/run-dsrpc).
